			<p>THE FIVE BIGGEST CASES OF THE PUBLIC PROTECTOR</p>

						<h3 class="cbp-nttrigger">Thuli Madonsela is appointed</h3>
						<h4 style="color:#CF0A0A;">2009, October 19</h4>
						<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
							<p style="text-align:justify;">Thuli Madonsela was appointed in 2009. Her predecessor, Lawrence Mushwana, was accused of being executive minded, having come down on the side of government one too many times, in cases that analysists insisted should have swung the other way. Many thought the Office of the Public Protector had no teeth.</p>

						<h3 class="cbp-nttrigger">Police chief Bheki Cele implicated in leasing scandal</h3>
						<h4 style="color:#CF0A0A;">2011, February 22</h4>
						<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
							<p style="text-align:justify;">Less than a year into her term, Madonsela's office receives a complaint about a leasing deal involving the leasing buildings in Durban and Pretoria to the Department of Public Works, for use by the SAPS. It will be her first politically-charged case, as it involves then-National Police Commissioner, Bheki Cele and a well-connected businessman and owner of the buildings, Roux Shabangu. 
							Madonsela finds that the lease was unlawful, and although she does not find that the SAPS was directly involved in influencing the deal, she recommends that action should be taken against the officials involved. Flowing from this, a board of inquiry is instituted to investigate Cele's fitness to hold office. He is dismissed </p>

						<h3 class="cbp-nttrigger">Minister Sicelo Shiceka's Swiss splurge</h3>
						<h4 style="color:#CF0A0A;">2011, October 11</h4>
						<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
							<p style="text-align:justify;">In April 1011, Madonsela investigated complaints that now-deceased minister Sicelo Shiceka splurged state funds on a trip to visit his girlfriend in Switzerland, and spent excessive amounts on hotel stays. She found that he had done so, and that the money spent by his department was "of no value to the state". Shiceka died in 2012.</p>

						<h3 class="cbp-nttrigger">Julius Malema's on point tender deal</h3>
						<h4 style="color:#CF0A0A;">2012, October 10</h4>
						<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
							<p style="text-align:justify;">Julius Malema and his business associates were investigated, following claims that then-ANCYL leader influenced Limpopo government officials to award tenders to a company he was linked to. While Madonsela could find no evidence that Malema used his influence, she found that the tenders were illegally awarded and recommended that they be cancelled.</p>

						<h3 class="cbp-nttrigger">Hlaudi with a chance of thunder</h3>
						<h4 style="color:#CF0A0A;">2014, February 4</h4>
						<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
							<p style="text-align:justify;">SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng is reported to the PP. It's alleged that he faked his matric certificate, irregularly hiked his salary, made improper appointments and abused his power. Madonsela finds that this is exactly what he did. She recommends that disciplinary action should be taken against him and other implicated officials.</p>

						<h4 style="color:#CF0A0A;">2014, March 19</h4>
						<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
